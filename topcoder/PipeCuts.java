/**
 * Problem Statement
 *  A 100 meter long pipe must be cut in two places. It can only be cut at certain places, where it
 *  was originally welded from smaller pipes. If the two cut locations are chosen at random (each
 *  potential location has equal probability of being chosen), find the probability of a resulting
 *  pipe being longer than L meters.
 *
 *  Create a method named probability that accepts a int[] weldLocations and int L as parameters. It
 *  should calculate the probability of one or more resulting pipes being strictly longer than L if
 *  the two cut locations are chosen at random from weldLocations. Each element in weldLocations
 *  represents the number of meters from the left end of the pipe
 *
 * Definition
 *   Class: PipeCuts
 *   Method: probability
 *   Parameters: int[], int
 *   Returns: double
 *   Method signature: double probability(int[] weldLocations, int L)
 *   (be sure your method is public)
 *
 *
 * Notes
 * - Your return value must have a relative or absolute error less than 1e-9.
 *
 * Constraints
 * - weldLocations will have between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.
 * - Each element in weldLocations will be between 1 and 99, inclusive.
 * - weldLocations will not contain duplicate elements.
 * - L will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
 *
 * Examples
 * 0)
 * {25, 50, 75}
 * 25
 * Returns: 1.0
 * Any random set of cuts results in a pipe being longer than 25 meters.
 *
 * 1)
 * {25, 50, 75}
 * 50
 * Returns: 0.0
 * This time, it is impossible to cut the pipe such that some resulting pipe is longer than
 * 50 meters.
 *
 * 2)
 * {25, 50, 75}
 * 24
 * Returns: 1.0
 *
 * 3)
 * {99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, 11}
 * 50
 * Returns: 0.7222222222222222
