 * Problem Statement
 *  You are a contestant on a TV quiz show. Throughout the game, you and your 2 opponents have
 *  accumulated points by answering trivia questions. At the end of the game, the three of you are
 *  given one final question. Before you hear the question, each contestant must decide how many
 *  points he or she wishes to wager. Each contestant who answers the question correctly will gain a
 *  number of points equal to his or her wager, while the others will lose a number of points equal
 *  to their respective wagers. The contestant who ends up with the highest score after the final
 *  question wins the game.
 *
 *  It has come to the point in the game where you must select your wager. You can bet any amount
 *  between zero and your current score, inclusive. Given your current score, the scores of your two
 *  opponents, and how much you believe each of your opponents will wager, compute how much you
 *  should wager in order to have the highest probability of winning the game. Assume that you and
 *  your opponents each independently have a 50% chance of answering the final question correctly.
 *
 *  You will be given the three scores as a int[], scores. The first element is your score, the next
 *  element is your first opponent's score, and the last element is your second opponent's score.
 *  You will also be given wager1 and wager2, the amount of your first and second opponents' wagers,
 *  respectively.
 *
 *  Your goal is to maximize your chance of winning uncontested. As far as you're concerned, ending
 *  in a tie is as bad as losing. If there are multiple wagers that give you the same highest
 *  probability of winning, return the smallest such wager. If you have no chance of winning, return
 *  zero.

 * Definition
 *  Class:    misc.QuizShow
 *  Method:    wager
 *  Parameters:    int[], int, int
 *  Returns:    int
 *  Method signature:    int wager(int[] scores, int wager1, int wager2)
 *  (be sure your method is public)
 *
 * Constraints
 *  - scores will contain exactly 3 elements.
 *  - Each element of scores will be between 0 and 10000, inclusive.
 *  - wager1 will be between 0 and scores[1], inclusive.
 *  - wager2 will be between 0 and scores[2], inclusive.
 *
 * Examples
 *  0)
 *  { 100, 100, 100 }
 *  25
 *  75
 *  Returns: 76
 *  If you bet 76, you have a 50% chance of winning. In this case, it doesn't matter if your opponents
 *  are right or wrong. If you are right, you win. Otherwise, you lose. If you wager less than 76, your
 *  chance of winning drops below 50%, and if you wager more, your chance of winning will not increase.
 *  Therefore, the correct answer is 76.
 *
 *  1)
 *  { 10, 50, 60 }
 *  30
 *  41
 *  Returns: 0
 *  Even if your opponents are both wrong, they will end up with 20 and 19 points. Since you cannot win
 *  (even if you wager 10), the correct answer is 0.
 *
 *  2)
 *  { 10, 50, 60 }
 *  31
 *  41
 *  Returns: 10
 *  This is the same as the previous example, except in this case your opponents will each end up with
 *  19 points if they are both wrong. Now, you have a 12.5% chance of winning if you wager 10.
 *
 *  3)
 *  { 2, 2, 12 }
 *  0
 *  10
 *  Returns: 1
 *
 *  4)
 *  { 10000, 10000, 10000 }
 *  9998
 *  9997
 *  Returns: 9999
 *
 *  5)
 *  { 5824, 4952, 6230 }
 *  364
 *  287
 *  Returns: 694
